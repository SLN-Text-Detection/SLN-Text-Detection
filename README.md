# SLN-Text-Detection

##Scale-residual Learning Network for Text Detection in the wild. Coding is adding. 


##Introduction

This is a source code of the paper "Scale-residual Learning Network for Text Detection in the wild".


##Installation
    Any version of tensorflow version > 1.0 should be ok.

##Download
    The COCO-Text was used to train the SLN model for 10 epochs, and then training datasets including COCO-Text, ICDAR 2015, and UCAS-STLData were adopted to fine-tune the model until convergence. The SLN model evaluated on the minettoâ€™s dataset used the model fine-tuned on ICDAR 2015. BaiduYun.
    
##Train
    If you want to train the model, you should provide the dataset path, in the dataset path, a separate gt text file should be provided for each image and run Train_SLN.py.
    
##Test
    Run eval_SLN.py, a text file will be then written to the output path.

##Results:
    In icdar 2015, F-score is 0.85 and FPS is 11.2. 
    In coco-text, F-score is 0.4661 ans FPS is 16.9. 
    In minetto's dataset, F-score is 0.81 ans FPS is 27.6.
    In UCAS_STLData, F-score is 0.91 ans FPS is 54.3.
