We establish a large-scale dataset for text detection in the wild. 
Our dataset, LS-Text, contains 36,000 images, and 270,783 text instances in them are manually annotated by quadrilateral labels. 
The LS-Text covers the challenges of point-and-shoot and incidental scene text objects. 
It has a wide range of scale changes, multi-direction, dense text distribution, uneven illumination, blurring and occlusion.


The LS-Text dataset will be downloaded soon.
